    <div class="about">
      <p>My passion for photography began halfway through high school in 2010. My mother was a dancer as part of a parade, and in the parade were individual sections. Each section had its own photographer except for my mother's section. The section leader asked me to photograph the parade, to which I said yes. She then handed me a camcorder that barely had the ability to capture photos. I gave it no less than my best efforts, and at the end of the parade, they were really happy with the photos. I was surprised that they liked them so much, and I decided to take up photography. From then on, I've grown exponentially. My dream is to live a happy, sustainable life through photography. Every day, I come one step closer to fulfilling that dream.</p>
